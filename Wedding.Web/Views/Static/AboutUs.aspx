<h3>Where was our first date?</h3>
<p>Our first date was to La Parilla, a Mexican restaurant, in Midtown. Over lunch we had our first disagreement:  which is better, the original Star Wars trilogy or the Alien quadrilogy. After lunch, we spent the afternoon at DramaTech building shelves for the props dock.</p>

<h3>How did Joseph propose?</h3>
